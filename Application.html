 Dear Peter <br><br>
<b>Re:Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</b><br> <br>
I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013. <br> <br>
I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the
position, including: <br> <br>
<ul>
  
<li> time management and strong organisational skills </li>
<li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
<li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
<li>motivation and dedication</li> </ul> <br> </p>

<p align="justify">As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer
service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career.
The
Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail
career. <br><br>
I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use
my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview. <br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
Yours sincerely <br><br><br>
Lizzie Long
